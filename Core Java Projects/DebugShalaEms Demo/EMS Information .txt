Project Overview for Core Java Students

Dear Students,

In this project, we will implement a comprehensive application that incorporates various core Java concepts we have covered so far. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the topics and their implementation within the project:

Abstraction and Encapsulation:
We will demonstrate abstraction and encapsulation through the Person and Date classes, where Person encapsulates personal details and Date encapsulates date-related details.

Association Relationship:
The association relationship will be implemented between the Person and Date classes, illustrating how objects can be linked.

Inheritance:

Single Inheritance:
We will implement single inheritance in the Employee class which extends the Person class.

Hierarchical Inheritance:
We will demonstrate hierarchical inheritance by creating subclasses SalesManager, Programmer, and Admin which all extend the Employee class.

Interfaces:
The ItTraveller interface will be implemented by the SalesManager and Programmer classes, providing travel allowance functionality.

Polymorphism:
In the main demo class, we will use polymorphism to create references of the Employee type and instantiate objects of subclasses like Programmer, SalesManager, and Admin.
We will also use the instanceof operator to handle potential errors and ensure type safety.
By integrating these concepts into a single project, you will gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of how these core Java principles work together in a real-world application.

Happy coding!

Best regards,
Tarun
